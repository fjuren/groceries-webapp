This is a grocery list and recipe making webapp created - for desktop and mobile screen sizes - that encourages recipe sharing within a community! 

I had a lot of fun putting this little pet project together. My goal with this was to consider usability design while practicing JS, react and applying material design. The current state of this webapp is still very much in an 'mvp' state, but I am pretty happy with where it is and intend to continue building functionality out further.

Hope you have fun poking around in this webapp I call Grocery! (I know, it needs a better name)
